- [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/MysticJinxx/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe)
- [Calculator](https://github.com/MysticJinxx/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Calculator)

### Pizza Menu

In this project, I made a simple pizza maker application. The user is able to select various sizes and toppings.
The program then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

It's you versus a computer opponent. The computer picks a random square to place its token. There are sound effects and music when you win, and draw. 

### Calculator

A basic calculator with 4 functions. User can add, subtract, multiply and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
